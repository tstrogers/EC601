More details can be found in our paper "Exposure to social bots amplifies perceptual biases and regulation propensity" Link: https://t.co/O8pmdcncO1

With @YyjHarry, @JamesShanahan, and @OSoMe_IU . 

7/7 

Participants prefer stricter regulations after exposure to bots. They express preferences for regulations targeting bot operators and social media companies, which may be due to uncertainty about one's ability to mitigate bot manipulation and fear of bot influence on others.
6/7 https://t.co/dPkzTamPG8 

Participants perceive a higher bot influence on others than on themselves. Perceived influence on others and on self both increase after exposure to bots, and the gap widens, showing a stronger bias.
5/7 https://t.co/0QZCIKEbQW 

Participants are confident in their ability to identify bots, but become less confident after exposure to bots. Interestingly, their self-assessment is not a very reliable predictor of their actual performance. Exposure to bots exacerbates their unreliability.
4/7 https://t.co/auBQdH40Pq 

Now the fun begins. Participants, on average, report that 32% of social media accounts are bots, which is substantially larger than the estimates provided by Twitter and even Musk. This number becomes 38% after exposure to bots.
3/7 https://t.co/CeJbfR5IlM 

First, the setup. We ran an experiment in which participants are asked to distinguish bot-like social media profiles from authentic users. They answer questions regarding their perceptions of bots before and after bot exposure.
2/7 

The prevalence of social bots has been at the center of the dispute between Twitter and Elon Musk amid Musk's takeover. But how does the public perceive the issue of social bots? Our new working paper sheds some light.

Congratulations to @ChrisTorresLugo for successfully defending his PhD dissertation "CATCH ME IF YOU CAN: ON THE DETECTION OF COORDINATED INAUTHENTIC BEHAVIOR ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ITS LIMITS"!! https://t.co/Oo8d4XaEWG 

A similar analysis for Tweetbotornot shows a bit lower performance and more sensitivity, but still promising results. 

There is much more, thou, so check out their papers! 

https://t.co/9bTJxMSCbb

bravo to the @DalhousieU's team (@ritapurity @AdlSnz &amp; @zinciran)! https://t.co/ePH8N2TNSw 

I found this analysis also very interesting: it shows the fraction of accounts that 'flip' with changing thresholds. Botwiki-2019 causes issues, and some other datasets are more sensitive to threshold, suggesting the need to correctly tune the threshold with proper validation! https://t.co/YWnEzcu7yz 

The performance on detection of human accounts is more uniform. At the same 0.5 threshold, the error rate is less than 1 in 5 for most scenarios. Obv, higher thresholds yield almost perfect human account detection, suggesting the precision-recall trade-off is an important factor! https://t.co/lptjMSmYcj 

Overall, @Botometer with the usual score threshold=0.5, appears highly accurate (percent of correctly detected bot accounts ~80% or more) in bot detection in all but 1 dataset (TwiBot-20)! So 0.5 is a good estimate to start any analysis, can be fine-tuned with manual validation! https://t.co/EbcqXB4edx 

Their analysis relies on a pretty diverse set of data sources, published in 15 different studies. Overall this provides good coverage of different types of bots and human accounts (including orgs or verified ones) https://t.co/QsVQ7rJqg8 

They first set to replicate other studies that looked at these two tools' accuracy over various datasets and tasks; spoiler: their replication shows better results than previous other studies, suggesting the tools are improving over time! https://t.co/iLMM7MB91L

Keep your eyes üëÄ peeled for more work on superspreaders in the future!!! 

Check out the (working!) paper (https://t.co/lLzaSiTEet) for all of the juicy details. 

Please do reach out to us with your comments and constructive criticism. 

We hope this work (1) spurs more research into superspreaders and (2) sheds light on one of our key concerns:

The more prominent misinformation superspreaders become, the greater their negative impact will be, and the more difficult they become to reign in. 

4b) Our analysis also suggests that Twitter may be more lenient with prominent superspreaders. 

Of the superspreaders who were suspended, less than 3% were verified and less than 10% had more than 150k followers. https://t.co/BgsXWULTYu 

4a) What is Twitter doing about it?
Unsurprisingly, many of the accounts we found were suspended by Twitter. Good, right? Maybe not‚Ä¶ 

3b) What they do:
We also learn that superspreaders utilize more toxic language than the average misinformation sharer on Twitter. https://t.co/zghdhnrZ1v 

3a) What they do:
Our analysis found that 10 superspreaders (0.003% of accounts) were responsible for originating over 34% of the misinformation shared during the eight months that followed their identification, and 1,000 accounts (0.25%) were responsible for more than 70%! https://t.co/nAPtKpb9qJ 

2) Who they are:
Many (not all) of the superspreaders we find are verified!

We find pundits with large followings, low-credibility media outlets, personal accounts affiliated with those media outlets, and a range of less popular influencers.

Most (not all) are conservative. https://t.co/FI0hzuNQxR 

1) How we find them:
We extend the classic h-index metric to the misinformation domain and propose the False Information Broadcaster index (FIB index).

This metric finds the worst misinfo. spreaders who consistently share low-credibility content. 

We use various metrics to predict whether an account will be a superspreader in future months and then see which ones perform the best. Then we do a qualitative review of the worst superspreaders we find and report what we learned.

The four major results are‚Ä¶ 

Can we find and predict which accounts spread the most #misinformation on Twitter? What is Twitter doing about misinformation #superspreaders?

We take a stab at this problem in our new working paper. https://t.co/lLzaSiC2PT
